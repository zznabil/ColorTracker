# Product Guidelines`n`n## Architectural Philosophy`n- **Clinical Precision:** The core logic must prioritize absolute determinism, type safety, and memory efficiency. We adhere to the "Sage" archetype for backend logic (`core/`, `utils/`), enforcing O(1) memory allocation and strictly typed interfaces.`n- **Aesthetic Excellence:** The frontend (`gui/`) follows the "Artisan" archetype, focusing on responsiveness, visual clarity, and fluid user interaction.`n`n## Code Standards`n- **Performance First:** Critical paths (detection, motion) must be optimized for zero-allocation and lock-free concurrency where possible.`n- **Robustness:** Systems should be "self-healing" (e.g., config recovery) and fail securely.`n- **Modularity:** Maintain strict separation between logic, data, and presentation layers.`n`n## Visual Identity`n- **Functional Minimalism:** The HUD and UI should provide maximum information density with minimal distraction.`n- **High-Contrast:** Use distinct colors and clear typography for readability in dynamic environments.
